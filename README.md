# CAPSTONE PROJECT: TASKMASTER

I had the privilege of participating in the 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) training program, an initiative of the Federal Government of Nigeria, specifically Cohort 2 (May 2024 - November 2024). During this program, I acquired comprehensive training in software engineering, among other disciplines.
The capstone project showcased here demonstrates my proficiency in various technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, database management, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, highlighting my skills and knowledge gained through the program.
